# Kuempel_offshore_wind_CIA

This repository accompanies the publication by Kuempel et al. "Frameworks and best practices for cumulative impact accounting in offshore energy development"

To recreate the analysis use the scripts provided:

1. Sankey_Plot.Rmd - this script recreates Figure 1 and the DAPSIR analysis
2. Cumulative_species_count_industries - this script recreates Figure 3 and the cumulative impact on species analysis
3. Figure4A.R - this script recreates Figure 4A and calculates the area covered by industry activity
4. industry_overlap_matrix.R - this script calculates the industry overlap, providing the data to recreate Figure 4
5. Figure4B.R - this script takes industry overlap data to make the overlap quantile plot (Figure 4B).

All data used to create the ocean uses analyses are publicly available, with data sources documented in Table S2.

Note that Figure 2 was created using Canva and powerpoint.
